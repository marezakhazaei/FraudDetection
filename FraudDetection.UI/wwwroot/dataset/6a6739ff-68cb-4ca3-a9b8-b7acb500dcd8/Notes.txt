parameters of fraud detection from bank perspective
===============================
Machine learning algorithms:
	- KNN: (N) (OK)++
	- Logistic Regression : fast training speed(P) (OK)++
	- Decision Tree: (N)
	- Neural Network:
	- Random forest: (N) OK++
	- Support Vector Machine:
	- Naive Bayes: fast training speed(P) (OK)++
===============================
Data pre-processing:
	- Data cleaning:
		- Remove missing values
		- Remove noisy data
	- Data Transformation:
		- Normalization
		- Standardization
	- Data Reduction:
		- Multicollinearity
		- Dimensionality reduction
===============================
Data balancing:
	- Oversampling
	- Undersampling

add new column for relevant citations 
data collection: justification to use relevant datasets, recent datasets, how accurate the datasets for analysis
after literature have a summery 
avoid some, try, several, numerous , ...
correct APA and citations
=================================
Time horizon: 
Primary and secondary research
Data analysis and Implementation sections
Future work: 
	- get confirmation from customer for detect fraud (interactive system)
	- using Tenserflow instead of scikit-learn
	- Compare reinforcement learning and deep learning algorithms with supervised algorithms
	- Using Apache Spark and R for data cleaning
